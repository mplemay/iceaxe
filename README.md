# iceaxe

A modern, fast ORM for Python. We have the following goals:

- **Performance**: We want to exceed or match the fastest ORMs in Python.
- **Typehinting**: Everything should be typehinted with expected types.
- **Postgres only**: Leverage native Postgres features and simplify the implementation.
- **Common is easy, rare is possible**: If you're writing _really_ complex queries, these are better done by hand so you can see exactly what SQL will be run by.
