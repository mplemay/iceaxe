# Queries

Queries allow you to retrieve data from your database. Every query you build with ORM objects
is a subclass of `QueryBuilder` at its base. This class provides a number of methods to help you
construct your query and pass the correct types for downstream processing.

## Shortcuts

We offer convenience functions for the most common SQL operations. This avoids
the need to instantiate a `QueryBuilder` directly every time you want a new SQL
query and typically results in cleaner code.

## Conditions

If you want to add conditions to your query, you can use the `where` method. If you pass multiple
conditions to this, they'll be chained together as an `AND` filter. To
combine OR and AND predicates together, you can use `and_` and `or_`.

::: iceaxe.queries.and_

::: iceaxe.queries.or_

## Enums

::: iceaxe.queries.JoinType
